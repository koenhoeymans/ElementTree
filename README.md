ElementTree
===========

ElementTree is a PHP library for handling a tree of components with XML-like
features. It is not XML however:

	* Not nearly as feature-rich.
	* Does not interfere with entities.
	* No single root element necessary.
	* Querying with fluent interface.

Documentation can be found in the form of [this](https://github.com/koenhoeymans/ElementTree/blob/master/EndToEndTests/DocumentationTest.php)
end-to-end test.

Installation can be done by the [packagist repository](https://packagist.org/) of
[composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
