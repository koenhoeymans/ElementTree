ElementTree Changelog
=====================

*   0.8.0

*	0.7.1

	*	Bug fixes for replacing components.

*	0.7.0

	*	Only `ElementTree` has utility method for creating query. Other
		components don't implement `Queryable` anymore and this interface
		is removed.
	*	Added `Component::getNextSibling` and `Component::getPreviousSibling`.
	*	Added `Composable::insertAfter` and `Composable::insertBefore`.
	*	Removed option to append after other component. One can use `insertAfter`
		for that.

*	0.6.0

	*	OwnerTrees are only OwnerTrees of components when they are added,
		not upon creation or after removal (another difference with DOM).

*	0.5.0

	*	`ElementTreeAttribute` is not `Appendable`.

*	0.4.0

	*	Introduced interface `Appendable`. An `ElementTree` object is not appendable.
		`ElementTreeElement`, `ElementTreeText`, `ElementTreeComment`,
		`ElementTreeAttribute` are appendable (to a `Composable`).

*	0.1.3

	*	Composite specifications now accept a `FilterBuilder` which provides a
		more fluent interface (otherwise they would need a `new` specification).
